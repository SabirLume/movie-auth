## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

In this project I used an API that grabs movie information. Including the movie's year it was realeased & and a quick description of the movie.

The user can save the movie they selected onto the dom.


## Lessons Learned:

I furthered my knowledge on how to use a API and save the information recieved from that API to my DB.
